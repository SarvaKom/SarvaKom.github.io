               It is often difficult to claim sovereignty of purely digital art as nowadays these forms are not appreciated as much due to the assertion that
               the machines and computers are predominantly responsible for the overall execution of these pieces. However, the labor that is often executed as a mere means to
               an end, deserves a lot more respect and recognition in terms of its potential. With a future that “never ages” thanks to this technology, digital art allows us
               to tell stories in a moment of time, where it continues to be shaped as consumers interact with the content.</p>
