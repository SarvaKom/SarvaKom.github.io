               “Consider a future device ... in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”

            Science has provided the “swiftest communication between individuals,” allowing records to evolve. At the same time, the limits and boundaries set in place stem from the achievable level of detail, excellence of particular systems, and efficiency of resources and tools within science. With these rapid improvements is what seems like a neverending library of information that is readily accessible. However, with the grandiose amount of data, it becomes difficult to consult, filter, hone in, or appreciate the large mass of material available to a user. Similarly, there exists this inherent level of compression, where we are forced to minimize our creations to provide for easy access. As a result, quality tends to be sacrificed while sharing ideas. Essentially, we utilize existing machines to alter our original language and satisfy or carry out a set of instructions. While the applications of science have given us plenty of supplies to live off of and a more extensive memory, it is up to us to decipher the best practices which will lead to a wiser and more promising future.</p>
